# Playground

To use the playground:

1. Call the page or component you want to render inside `./render.ts`
2. Build the project with `deno task build`
3. Watch for changes with `deno task watch`
4. Launch a live server and open `index.html`
5. Have fun, explore, modify and reach out if you find bugs or improvements!
